# was an unnegated mirror copy (a plotting convenience, since |S(2π−θ)|=|S(θ)|).
# The refactored calculate_S computes every angle directly, so its second half
# is the true S(θ) — sign-flipped vs the old copy. We therefore regression-test
# against the directly-computed half only; it covers every independent value.
